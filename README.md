# DrupalCon Training! D8 & Symfony: Dive Into the Core Concepts that Make Each Fly 

Hi guys! This repository contains an empty Drupal 8.5 site that you'll
need to install before coming to the training.

The goal is to make the training feels as "normal" as possible. So,
if you normally use a VM, then install this on a VM. If you normally
do local development, install this locally on your machine.

If you have **any** problems or questions at all, just message
me (Ryan) at ``ryan@knpuniversity.com`` :).

## 1) Pre-requisites

Before you start, you'll need to make sure your system has a few
things setup:

* Access to the command line. If you're in Windows, "command" is
    ok, but something like cygwin or Git Bash is even better.

* Git - you'll need this to clone this repository

* MySQL (or MariaDB or SQLite - whatever your favorite database server is)

* PHP version 5.6 or higher

## 2) Clone this repository

Clone this repository down onto your machine (you can use any directory).

From the command line, this is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weaverryan/drupalcon-nashville-training.git
```

## 3) Install the Composer Dependencies

In order to download Symfony and other "vendor" dependencies, run,
move into the directory and run:

```
cd drupalcon-nashville-training
php composer.phar install
```

If you see any errors, read them carefully (or message me!).
If, for example, you're missing a needed PHP extension, you
might see a big error that includes details about this.

We'll talk more about this step in the training :).

## 4) Point your Web Server at the site

You can use any web server for the training, but I highly recommend
the built-in PHP web server because it requires zero setup. From
the command line, move into your new directory and run:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

That's it! You should be able to go to ``http://localhost:8000``
to pull up your site! When you're finished, press `Ctrl+C` to
terminate the built-in web server. We'll start it again when
you get to the training. If you use this, you do *not* need to
configure Apache or Nginx (but you can if you like that better).

While the PHP web server is running, you will not be able to use
that terminal. Open a new terminal to run any other commands you
need :).

**NOTE** If you're using a virtual machine, no problem! Update the
command to be `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000` and then use your VM's IP address
in your browser to access it.

## 5) Install the Drupal Site

Finally, make sure you've gone through the Drupal site install
process. You can do this however you want, for example:

A) You can go to `http://localhost:8000` and install via the web interface

B) Use **Drupal console**

(if you've started the built-in web server on the previous step, you'll need
to open a new terminal tab. Move into the site directory, then run:

```
./vendor/bin/drupal site:install
```

Use the "Standard" install option

C) Or you can use **Drush** (which is pre-installed inside this project). For example:

**NOTE**: I received an error when using this option. So, use it at your own risk!

```
./vendor/bin/drush site-install --db-url=mysql://root@localhost/d8_nashville
```

(update the connection details based on your system!)

## 6) Turn error display on

If we make any mistakes, we'll want to see them! To do that, in
the web interface:

A) Login with your admin user
B) Go to Manage -> Configuration -> Logging and errors
C) Choose "All messages, with backtrace information" and click "Save Configuration"

That's it! Make sure you can access and see your site! You're
now all ready for the training! Come ready to do some coding :).

Cheers!
